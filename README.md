# How to Plan and Build a Project

This article describes the process I have been using for several years to plan how to build any project whether it is a smaller personal project or a large project with a team of developers. This is also similar to the process we use on our team at work.

To get started, we create three very short and simple artifacts before starting to building a new project. A one-pager, a workflow diagram, and a task list. Depending on the size of the project, this usually takes one person a day or less to complete.

These artifacts are created in this order. First, a one-page description of the project in human terms. Anyone should be able to read this single page and know what the project will do. Next, a workflow diagram is created which is actually a combination sequence, class, and workflow diagram. Once the workflow diagram is done, a task list is created from the workflow diagram with tasks broken down into single day units of work. The task list tells us where to start and what else we will be doing each day until the project is done.

The following describes these three artifacts using a small project as an example.

## How to Write a One-Pager

A one-pager is typically a single page or less that describes the project in human terms so anyone reading it will know what the project will do. I usually just start describing the project, usually starting with the problem that needs to be solved and what I want it to do.

For a personal project, I am the one who writes the one-pager. At work, the one-pager is typically written by the product owner.

## Sample one-pager

# Landing Page Service

We have some courses and other digital products we would like to create landing pages for that will collect the email addresses of people interested in each of these products.

We would like to collect the email addresses somewhere so we can send out emails to inform our prospective customers about the products they are interested in. It would be nice if the system would automatically send a response email thanking the prospective customer for registering. That would give the customer an immediate response rather than waiting for us to notice that a new customer registered and then sending them an email manually much later.

Since we will have several digital products the emails sent to the customer should be tailored to the product they are interested in. That way, we can customize the email sent out for a particular product.

It would be nice to have the ability to create an email template for a product that way we can personalize the email with their name or other information about the product.

We have seen other email marketing systems that can send out a series of emails spaced out with a couple of days in between. We would like to be able to schedule a series of emails for a product and specify the number of days in between each email and the next one.

Some of the emails may have links to PDFs or other downloadable links.

Once a customer purchases a product, they should no longer receive sales related emails and they should now be sent product related update emails.

We would like to track where an email addresses was submitted from so we can see which marketing campaigns were successful and which ones were not and at what point the customer converted. There could be several locations with the email input form and it is possible we will add this to blog articles or other places.

A customer should be able to unsubscribe from receiving emails. If customer registers again after unsubscribing we would like that email address to be reactivated from where they left off.

## How to Create a Workflow Diagram

Next, we create a workflow diagram from the one-pager description. This workflow diagram is a combination of a sequence diagram and a class diagram done in a workflow like form. This diagram does not use strict UML, just boxes and lines with arrows or diamonds, and a bunch on text in the whitespace to describe that part of the diagram. I often number the steps or show some form of entry point so the reader knows where to start from. The boxes are classes or screen mockups, the lines with arrows indicate the direction of flow while the lines with diamonds indicate class relationships.

## Sample workflow diagram

![workflow diagram](https://github.com/bigspotteddog/landing-page-service/blob/main/landing_page_service_tasked.png?raw=true)


To create this diagram, I am using Balsamiq Mockups but you can use anything that can draw boxes and lines. I used to use paper and pencil. Balsamiq has that browser widget you see on the left but it could just as well be a box that said browser in the middle of it.

I started drawing this diagram from the one-pager by going through it looking for things that have information we need. Looking at the one-pager, I picked the word "product" from the first paragraph and figured it should have a name and description. Reading through the next few paragraphs, I picked out the word "email" and drew that box. Don't start connecting lines yet, just put the boxes on the diagram on the first pass. From there I put all of the other boxes on the diagram then started grouping the boxes that should be next to each other. After that, I drew the lines and put some of the text from the one-pager on the diagram reworded to describe the program flow.

With the diagram completed, it is easier to review the system to see milestone boundaries for releases. In the diagram, we were able to trim out an MVP by simply having the receiving handler send out a response email instead of having to develop the automated part of the system to get an initial release of something functional.

Once the task breakdown step is completed (below) the tasks identified are added to the workflow diagram to show what part of the system that task builds.

## How to Create a Task Breakdown

With the workflow diagram completed, I start from the entry point and create a task list to complete that one box or line on the diagram. This could be a single task if it can be completed in a day; otherwise, it ends up being a description of what needs to be accomplished and a list of subtasks are created in single day chunks until the parent task is completely tasked out. Then it is on to the next box or line in the work flow. Sometimes, there are multiple entry points so each of those are addressed in the same manner.

In the diagram above, the entry point for the MVP starts with the web page form at step 4.

Task durations can be whatever you or your team are comfortable with. For myself, I like one day tasks because it is a day of work or less. I often have gaps in time that I am working on a personal project, so having the task done is better than trying to remember where I was a few days ago. With a team, you have pull requests to be reviewed then testing, so a single day of development will typically run about 3 days with 24-hour turnaround. One for development, one for review and any changes, one for testing.

This sample task breakdown has all of the system tasked out to give a complete example. Normally, I would only task the part that is going to be built in the current release. In this case, the MVP in blue on the diagram would be the only part tasked out or tasks 1 through 9 below.

With the task list, I know where to start and what I will be doing one task after the other until the project is done.
