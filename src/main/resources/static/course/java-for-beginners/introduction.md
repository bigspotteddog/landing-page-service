# Introduction

This series of lessons are geared to take Java beginners from little or no knowledge to building a Java web application that can receive and respond to an HTML page request.

You will learn how to set up a Java development environment with Java 11 and Visual Studio Code. Then we will go through the Java language basics and programming fundmentals.

For our first project we will build a simple Hello, World! application.

For our next project we will build a simple calculator to exercise what we have learned about Java math, Strings, and conditional logic.

Finally, we will conclude with a Spring Boot web application that takes in a name from an HTML for field and returns "Hello, &lt;`name`&gt;!".

## Our Stack

### Front end

* a little HTML and JavaScript
