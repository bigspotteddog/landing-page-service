## Exercise 8: Web Server Address Book

For this exercise, we will leverage Spring Boot to create a web server address book. We will learn you to initialize a simple Spring Boot application and a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along the way to implementing our Java backend address book.

Use what we learned in the `Variables Explained` lesson to apply the `Map` address book we created to store address entries on the backend. This `Map` is what we will use as our "database".
