## Full Stack Address Book

For exercise 8, we are going to build a full stack address book using what we have learned so far along with learning how to start a Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr. We will use Spring Boot to host our Java backend as well as host our front end.

This exercise will be broken into a series of videos because it is a bit bigger than the other exercises so far.

In addition to learning how to initialize a Spring Boot Java backend, we will learn a little HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Bootstrap to build out a front end to exercise our Java backend.

We will initialize our Spring Boot server at:

https://start.spring.io.

We will copy and paste our HTML starter template from:

We will copy and paste our HTML address form from:
