The assignment operator `=` assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

```java
int thing = 2; // = 2
```

### `+=`

The addition assignment operator assigns the sum of the variable value on the left and the addend value on the right.

```java
int thing = 2;
thing += 3; // = 5
```

### `-=`

The subtraction assignment operator assigns the difference of the minuend variable value on the left and the subtrahend value on the right.

```java
int thing = 5;
thing -= 2; // = 3
```

### `*=`

The multiplication assignment operator assigns the product of the multiplicand variable value on the left by the multiplier value on the right.

```java
int thing = 5;
thing *= 3; // = 15
```

### `/=`

The division assignment operator assigns the quotient of the dividend variable value on the left by the divisor value on the right.

```java
int thing = 15;
thing /= 3; // = 5
```

### `%=`
